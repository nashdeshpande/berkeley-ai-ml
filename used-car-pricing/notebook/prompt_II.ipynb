    "In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

By analyzing the coefficients or feature importance from the trained model, we can identify which attributes have the strongest correlation with the sale price, thus identifying the key drivers, and help a used car dealership better curate inventory and pricing strategies."

    "1.  **Load the dataset:** Start by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.\n",

    "    *   Use `.head()` and `.tail()` to see the first and last few rows.\n",
    "    *   Use `.info()` to get a summary of the DataFrame, including column names, data types, and non-null counts. This helps in identifying missing values.\n",

    "    *   Use `.columns` to list all column names.\n",

    "7.  **Identify potential quality issues:**\n",

    "    *   **Inconsistent data:** Look for variations in how categories are spelled or represented (e.g., \"New York\" vs. \"NY\").\n",
    "    *   **Outliers:** Identify extreme values in numerical features using box plots or statistical methods.\n",
    "    *   **Incorrect data types:** Ensure columns are stored in the correct data type.\n",
    "    *   **Duplicate rows:** Check for and remove duplicate entries in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Relate data to business understanding:** Consider how each feature might influence car prices. For example, what is the expected relationship between mileage and price? How might the car's make or model affect its value? Use this exploration to form hypotheses about which features will be most important for the price prediction model."
